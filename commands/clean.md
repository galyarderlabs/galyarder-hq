# Clean Command

This command invokes the **refactor-cleaner** agent to reduce technical debt.

## What This Command Does

1. **Dead Code Detection** - Runs tools like `knip` or `ts-prune` to find unused exports.
2. **Consolidation** - Merges duplicated logic into shared utilities.
3. **Refactoring** - Simplifies complex functions and deepens shallow modules.

---
**Note**: This command is powered by the `galyarder-framework:improve-codebase-architecture` skill.
