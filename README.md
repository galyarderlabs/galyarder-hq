# Galyarder Agent Framework

Galyarder Agent Framework is a high-fidelity cognitive layer designed to transform standard AI coding assistants into a multi-disciplinary, autonomous workforce. It unifies elite software engineering, behavioral marketing psychology, and strategic product orchestration into a single, cohesive system.

Built for the **1-Man Army** (Solo Founder), Galyarder enforces a strict lifecycle that ensures what you build is mathematically sound, production-ready, and optimized for market success.

## How it works

It starts from the moment you fire up your coding agent. As soon as it sees that you're building something, it *doesn't* just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do. 

Once it's teased a spec out of the conversation, it shows it to you in chunks short enough to actually read and digest. 

After you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan that's clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow. It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY. 

Next up, once you say "go", it launches a *subagent-driven-development* process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for Claude to be able to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.

Finally, Galyarder Agent Framework shifts into **Marketing Mode**, triggering skills for SEO, CRO, and Remotion (Video) to ensure what you built actually achieves market fit.

There's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special. Your coding agent just has Galyarder Agent Framework.
