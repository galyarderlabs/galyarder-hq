# Galyarder Import Adapt Reject Rubric

## Purpose
This rubric defines how Galyarder should evaluate external skills before hiring them into the digital company.

The goal is to avoid random collection behavior and make every hire accountable to a department and founder outcome.

## The Three Outcomes
### Import
Use when the external skill is already strong, reusable, and close to Galyarder quality with minimal changes.

### Adapt
Use when the external skill is promising but needs:
- stronger output contracts
- host compatibility cleanup
- workflow tightening
- Galyarder-specific reporting or department fit

### Reject
Use when the skill adds breadth without real leverage, duplicates current capability too closely, or creates ambiguity.

## Evaluation Dimensions
### 1. Department Fit
Questions:
- Which department does this strengthen?
- Which agent will manage it?
- Is the ownership obvious?

If the answer is unclear, default toward reject or hold.

### 2. Founder Leverage
Questions:
- Does this reduce founder workload meaningfully?
- Does it improve reporting, execution quality, or speed?
- Does it strengthen a real business function?

If not, it should not be a priority hire.

### 3. Capability Gap
Questions:
- Is Galyarder currently weak in this area?
- Does this materially outperform what already exists?
- Is the improvement obvious enough to justify the complexity?

### 4. Workflow Compatibility
Questions:
- Does it fit Galyarder's constitution?
- Can it work under RTK / Linear / verification expectations?
- Does it conflict with existing orchestration patterns?

### 5. Host Portability
Questions:
- Are the tool assumptions portable?
- Can it be made valid for Gemini / Codex / Claude where needed?
- Does it create unnecessary host-specific fragility?

### 6. Reporting Value
Questions:
- Can this worker produce founder-readable output?
- Can its results be surfaced through Obsidian and linked to Linear?

If the skill is operationally useful but impossible to report cleanly, it likely needs adaptation.

### 7. Maintenance Burden
Questions:
- Will this become expensive to maintain?
- Does it require many dependencies or exotic assumptions?
- Does it increase complexity faster than it increases leverage?

## Scoring Model
Use a simple score out of 5 for each:
- department fit
- founder leverage
- capability gap value
- workflow compatibility
- host portability
- reporting value
- maintenance burden (reverse-score complexity)

### Rough decision thresholds
- **Import**: strong across the board, low cleanup required
- **Adapt**: valuable but needs cleanup or re-framing
- **Reject**: weak leverage, poor fit, or too much overlap

## Mandatory Metadata Before Hiring
Every candidate hire should record:
- source repo
- source skill name
- target department
- target managing agent
- import / adapt / reject recommendation
- rationale
- host concerns
- founder-facing value

## Red Flags
Reject or pause if:
- no clear department owner exists
- it duplicates current capability without strong improvement
- it cannot be explained in terms of founder leverage
- it creates install or host fragility with low upside
- it encourages breadth over structure

## Golden Rule
Do not hire because a skill looks cool.
Hire because it makes a department stronger and improves the founder's leverage through a clearer digital company.
