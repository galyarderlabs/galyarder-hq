# Galyarder Linear Operating Model

## Purpose
This document defines how the digital company should use Linear as the execution system of record.

Linear is not the vision layer.
Linear is the operating layer.

## Core Principle
Every important company task should exist in Linear before deep execution starts.

This includes:
- product initiatives
- engineering execution
- growth experiments
- fundraising operations
- legal / compliance actions
- infra / release work
- knowledge-system buildouts when they require sustained work

## Recommended Structure
### Team Model
Recommended Linear teams:
- Foundation
- Product
- Engineering
- Growth
- Founder Office
- Security
- Operations
- Legal-Finance
- Knowledge

If that is too heavy initially, start with:
- Core
- Growth
- Founder Office

## Project Model
Projects should represent larger strategic workstreams.

Examples:
- Founder Pod Buildout
- Engineering Skill Audit
- Growth Department Upgrade
- Obsidian Reporting System
- Founder Reporting Templates
- Security Department Mapping

## Issue Model
Issues should represent actual units of work.

Each issue should have:
- owner agent / department
- clear objective
- definition of done
- linked parent project
- risk or impact context

## Labels
Recommended labels:
- foundation
- founder-office
- product
- engineering
- growth
- security
- ops
- legal-finance
- knowledge
- docs
- skill-import
- agent-mapping
- reporting

## Status Flow
Recommended status flow:
- Backlog
- Ready
- In Progress
- Review
- Verified
- Done

Optional risk states:
- Blocked
- Waiting on Founder

## Routing Rule
Linear should make it obvious:
- which department owns the work
- which agent leads it
- what skill stack is likely involved
- what founder decision, if any, is required

## Definition Of Good Linear Hygiene
A healthy issue should answer:
- what is being done?
- why does it matter?
- who owns it?
- what done looks like?
- what risk exists if it slips?

## Workstream Templates
### Agent Buildout Issue Template
- Goal:
- Department:
- Agent owner:
- Skills to add / map:
- Definition of done:
- Reporting impact:

### Skill Import Issue Template
- Source repo:
- Candidate skill:
- Target department:
- Target agent:
- Import / adapt / reject:
- License check:
- Host compatibility notes:
- Definition of done:

### Reporting System Issue Template
- Department:
- Report type:
- Obsidian target:
- Frequency:
- Founder audience:
- Definition of done:

## Relationship To Obsidian
Linear tracks execution.
Obsidian preserves knowledge, reports, and decisions.

A healthy loop is:
1. work is created in Linear
2. execution happens against Linear
3. results and conclusions are summarized into Obsidian
4. founder reads Obsidian summaries, not raw ticket noise
